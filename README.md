About
-----

Pbmon is a pastebit monitor library that aims to be a simple handy abstraction
based on https://github.com/dutchcoders/gopastebin.

It allows user to do whatever she wants with a new available paste by using
callbacks.

Take a look at the
[logger example](https://github.com/ilyaglow/pbmon/blob/master/examples/logger/logger.go)
to get the idea how to use it.
